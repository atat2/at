1. TallBuilding-1 - Made from basic geometry
2. Bus - Made from basic geometry

(Required) Five other kinds of objects that you created (possibly in previous assignments):
3. Hall-1 - Made from basic geometry
4. BladelessHelicopter - loaded from obj file (self made), attribution below
5. Tree_Round - loaded from obj file (self made), attribution below
6. Hill - Made from basic geometry
7. Building1-1 - uses own code from wb08 (08-06-buildings.js)

(Optional) Backup Objects (more objects that you created, in case the ones above don't count):
- Truck-0 - created from my own code from wb07 (07-09-constructionobjects.js)
